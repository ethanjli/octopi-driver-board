- The shape in the F.CrtYd layer was changed from a solid rectangle to a hollow rectangle.
- Drawings for the pins and plastic body were added in F.SilkS for the shape of pins, based on drawings in F.Fab.
- The courtyard-shaped box around the footprint in F.SilkS was replaced with corner markings.
- Annotations in the Dwgs.User layer were removed in the modified version.
- Silkscreen labels were changed to standard thicknesses and heights, and some labels were removed or moved.
